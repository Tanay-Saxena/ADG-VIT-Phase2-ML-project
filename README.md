Problem 1
ACME Insurance Inc. offers affordable health insurance to thousands of customer
all over the United States. As the lead data scientist at ACME, you're tasked with
creating an automated system to estimate the annual medical expenditure for
new customers, using information such as their age, sex, BMI, children, smoking
habits and region of residence.
Estimates from your system will be used to determine the annual insurance
premium (amount paid every month) offered to the customer. Due to regulatory
requirements, you must be able to explain why your system outputs a certain
prediction.
What's the lowest value of loss you are able to achieve?

Problem 2
This case requires trainees to develop a model for predicting fraudulent
transactions for a financial company and use insights from the model to
develop an actionable plan. Data for the case is available in CSV format having
more than 6000k rows and 10 columns.
Candidates can use whatever method they wish to develop their machine learning
model. Following usual model development procedures, the model would be

estimated on the calibration data and tested on the validation data. This case
requires both statistical analysis and creativity/judgment. We recommend you
spend time on both fine-tuning and interpreting the results of your machine learning
model.
